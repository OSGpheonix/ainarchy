# Ainarchy

Ainarchy is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of Next.js to provide a seamless and efficient development experience. This project is designed to explore the boundaries of AI capabilities through a unique jailbreak feature.

## Project Description

Ainarchy is a Next.js application that demonstrates the potential of AI by implementing a jailbreak feature. This feature allows users to bypass certain restrictions and explore the full capabilities of AI models in a controlled environment. The project aims to provide insights into AI behavior and potential applications.

## Jailbreak Functionality

The core feature of Ainarchy is the jailbreak, which enables users to interact with AI models without the usual constraints. This functionality is designed to:

- Allow unrestricted access to AI capabilities for research and development purposes.
- Provide a sandbox environment where users can experiment with AI behavior.
- Offer insights into the potential and limitations of AI models.

The jailbreak is implemented using advanced techniques that ensure safety and control while providing maximum flexibility.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
